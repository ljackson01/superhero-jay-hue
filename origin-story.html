    Jay Hue, born Jeremy Hue, is from Northeast Washington D.C. When Jeremy turned 10 he refused to answer to the name Jeremy because the boys and girls at school said black boys aren’t named Jeremy. From then, he only went by Jay.<br><br>

    Jay may not admit it but, he had a terrible time going through school. He struggled with trying to fit in. Around the age of 16, he started getting interested in how he could use humor to hide his pain and try to connect to the others. Jay used humor to make friends, he started with self-deprecating jokes, but that all changed after he saw Spike Lee’s “Malcolm X”. From that point on, Jay truly began to start to respect his skin and who he was as a black man in this world. He learned that in a world that already wants to see him fail, he’s never going to get anywhere if he hates himself also. Jay started to get inspired by the racial injustices he encountered and witnessed in college and so forth and channelled his energy into making jokes about how fucked up people treat people of color. He used his humor as an easy approach for people to be more willing to listen about racism.</div>
